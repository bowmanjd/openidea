Okay, this is a great initiative! A 5-minute slot means you need to be concise, impactful, and very clear. Here's an outline and visual suggestions:

**Overall Goal:** Get buy-in for the idea and spark discussion for implementation.

**Theme:** "Investing in Our Foundations: Supporting the Open Source We Depend On"

---

**Presentation Outline (5 Minutes)**

**(Slide 1: Title Slide - ~30 seconds)**

*   **Title:** Investing in Our Foundations: Supporting the Open Source We Rely On
*   **Subtitle:** A Proposal for an Open Source Contributor Fund
*   **Your Name/Team**
*   **Visual:**
    *   Company Logo alongside the Open Source Initiative logo (or a generic "gears working together" graphic).
    *   *Subtle background:* A faded collage of popular open-source tool logos that your company might use (e.g., Linux, Apache, Git, Docker, Kubernetes, Python, Node.js, React, etc.).

*   **Talking Points:**
    *   "Good morning/afternoon, everyone. Today, I want to talk about something crucial to our work: open source software."
    *   "And more specifically, how we can give back to the creators who build the tools that power our success."

**(Slide 2: The "Why" - We Stand on the Shoulders of Giants (~75 seconds)**

*   **Title:** We Depend on Open Source
*   **Key Message:** Open source isn't just "free software"; it's the bedrock of modern development.
*   **Visual:**
    *   **Option A (Impactful):** A simplified diagram of your company's tech stack, with key open-source components clearly highlighted (e.g., "Our App" on top of "Framework X (OS)", "Database Y (OS)", "OS Z (OS)").
    *   **Option B (General):** A graphic showing many common software categories (OS, Web Servers, Databases, Libraries, Dev Tools) with "Open Source" labels.

*   **Talking Points:**
    *   "Every single day, our teams leverage incredible open-source tools. Think about [mention 1-2 specific, widely used OS tools your company *definitely* uses, e.g., 'our CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins,' 'our frontend with React,' 'our backend with Spring Boot']."
    *   "These tools save us countless hours and resources, allowing us to build innovative products for our clients."
    *   "But this amazing ecosystem often relies on a few dedicated individuals, sometimes working in their spare time, often without direct financial support for *that specific project*."

**(Slide 3: The "Challenge" - Sustainability & Our Role (~60 seconds)**

*   **Title:** The Unseen Effort & How We Can Help
*   **Key Message:** Many vital projects are under-resourced. We can make a difference.
*   **Visual:**
    *   **Option A:** A graphic of a single person juggling many tasks (representing an under-resourced OS maintainer).
    *   **Option B:** A "tipping scales" graphic, with "Value We Receive" heavily outweighing "Support We Give."

*   **Talking Points:**
    *   "The reality is, many of these crucial projects are maintained by a small number of developers. Burnout is real, and projects can stagnate or be abandoned if maintainers don't have the support they need."
    *   "What if a critical library we depend on stops getting updates or security patches because the developer can no longer afford to work on it?"
    *   "We have an opportunity to contribute to the health and sustainability of this ecosystem we benefit so much from."

**(Slide 4: The Proposal - The "[Company Name] OS Contributor Fund" (~75 seconds)**

*   **Title:** Our Proposal: The [Company Name] OS Contributor Fund
*   **Key Message:** A small, focused start to make a tangible impact.
*   **Visual:**
    *   A piggy bank or a small growing sapling with a "$500/year (to start)" label.
    *   Text bullets:
        *   **Initial Fund:** $500 per year
        *   **Focus:** Developers of OS tools we *rely on*
        *   **Goal:** Provide direct financial support

*   **Talking Points:**
    *   "I propose we start small but meaningfully: Let's establish an annual '[Company Name] Open Source Contributor Fund' with an initial budget of $500."
    *   "This fund would allow us to make direct donations to individual developers or small teams behind open-source projects that are critical to *our* work."
    *   "Think of it as a thank you, a coffee, or help towards their server costs – a small token that can make a big difference to someone."
    *   "We can decide collectively how to identify and select recipients – perhaps through nominations from our own dev teams."

**(Slide 5: Benefits & Next Steps (~60 seconds)**

*   **Title:** Why This Matters & What's Next
*   **Key Message:** It's good for OS, good for us, and the right thing to do.
*   **Visual:**
    *   Simple icons representing benefits:
        *   Handshake (Goodwill/Reputation)
        *   Heart/Thumbs Up (Developer Morale/Engagement)
        *   Shield (Risk Mitigation - helping sustain tools)
        *   Seedling growing (Ecosystem Health)
    *   Clear "Next Steps" text.

*   **Talking Points:**
    *   **"Benefits are manifold:"**
        *   **Supports the Ecosystem:** Helps keep essential tools alive and maintained.
        *   **Boosts Morale:** Shows our developers we value the OS community they're part of.
        *   **Enhances Reputation:** Positions us as a responsible and appreciative tech company.
        *   **Small Investment, Potential Big Impact:** Even $50-$100 can be significant for an individual maintainer.
    *   **"This is a starting point. If successful, we can explore growing the fund or other ways to contribute (like dedicated time for OS contributions)."**
    *   **"My ask today: Let's greenlight this $500 pilot fund. I'm happy to help coordinate the first round of nominations and donations."**
    *   "Thank you. Any initial thoughts or questions?"

**Tips for Delivery:**

1.  **Practice Your Timing:** 5 minutes goes FAST. Rehearse it several times.
2.  **Be Enthusiastic:** Your passion for this will be infectious.
3.  **Know Your Audience:** Tailor your examples of OS tools to what your company *actually* uses heavily.
4.  **Keep Visuals Simple:** One key message per slide. Don't overload with text.
5.  **Focus on "Us":** Frame the benefits in terms of what the *company* and its *employees* gain.
6.  **Acknowledge the Small Start:** Present $500 as a pragmatic first step, not the ultimate solution, to manage expectations and make it an easy "yes."

Good luck! This is a commendable initiative.
