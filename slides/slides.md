## Engaging the Free Software behind our Productivity

<!--
I am Jonathan Bowman. Inviting you to consider how we can be aware and involved in the free software that sustains our work here at Cargas.

## Proposal

A "coin jar" of $1000 annually to distribute to free software projects with or upon which our products are built

<!-- 
The idea, in a nutshell: that we have $1000 to play a game of generosity and gratitude once a year. Give back to the maintainers of the open source software we rely on.

It shouldn't be a surprise to us at Cargas that values, and software can go hand in hand. And our values are shaped by our stories. So I'd like to start with a bit of my story around software and values.

It was 1999, and I was an idealistic college student. And I was captivated by values of sustainability and openness. For instance, I had friends were pursuing sustainable engineering, sustainable agriculture. That is, technologies that were accessible, affordable, and met the needs of people over the long term, even generations, rather than merely take advantage of them in the moment. And I loved listening to these friends' ideas.

And I found this compelling. But I was not a civil engineer or a farmer. I was a general nerd, though. I then someone turned me on to Linux. Linux is an operating system. This is Tux, the Linux penguin. Linux was sustainable software. Software that was open and transparent, available for free yet providing revenue-generating opportunities. It was software that was high quality, flexible, and enduring.

Today, each of you use Linux throughout a sizeable portion of your day. Linux, and other Unix-like free operating systems such as Darwin and BSD have been around for decades, yet power the iPhone or Android device you have in your pocket, and most of the web you use on a regular basis.

<!-- Fast forward to today. My values are similar to the college student that was first attracted to open source software. And while I still use Linux every day and all day, the values of collaboration, being open, finding enduring methods for success (aka "built to last") -- these values are primarily fleshed out here at work at Cargas. A place of work I remain attracted to for the same reasons I was attracted to open source software to begin with.

In other words, there is some ideological convergence here. And the potential for more.

I'd like to introduce or remind us of what and who open source software is. Some of the biggest software cornerstones are free and open source. I suspect there is at least one of these you recognize. VS Code, React, Apache Spark and almost anything to do with data science. These are free as in free of cost. But also free as in open and free as in collaboratively developed.

You may also notice the size and wealth of the companies behind these. Microsoft, Meta, Google. Some big non-profits, too, which are backed by Microsoft, Google, IBM...

But not all open source projects have the backing of giants. A lot of them have normal individuals behind them. And average-sized companies, too. Here is a random selection of smaller, perhaps unheard of, open source projects that people at Cargas rely on. Some have good financial backing, some do not.

I am inviting us to dream a bit of what it might look like to honor these community partners, express gratitude, and continue choosing and using such tools.

## Dreaming...

- Favor open source tools and building blocks over esoteric and proprietary 
- Learn processes and culture from established open source projects
- Consider the [Open Source Pledge](https://opensourcepledge.com/)
- Donate to [Open Source Collective](https://opencollective.com)
- Use developer time to contribute code back to open source tools
  - maybe a Hackathon!
- release some open source projects in a public repository

<!--
A reminder that the title of this exercise does have "Unlimited" after the word "Ideas" so here are a slew of things I dream of, just to put some ideas in your head. They range from "oh, easy and fun!" to "that's crazy talk". Here goes... I dream of Cargas leaning further into and open source preference when choosing tools upon which we build our products. In software, "you get what you pay for" is patently untrue (feel free to ask me to elaborate if you want me to get on a soapbox). I dream of us digging into the processes and methodologies of quality open source project to make our own processes more efficient and reliable. I dream of Cargas signing on to the Open Source pledge -- committing a minimum of $2000 back to open source per year per full time developer. (That's the crazy talk). And/or regularly donating to non-profits like "Open Source Collective" or "Apache Foundation". I think we could also contribute with time, which would give us immediate functional benefits as well. Perhaps we take a day once a year, choose a tool and goal we benefit from, and do a Hackathon with anyone who is interested. Maybe some day we identify a tool we want to contribute to open source, and increase our rapport as a company within the software developer community.

## A Modest Exercise

A "coin jar" of $1000 annually to distribute to free software projects with or upon which our products are built

- to give back
- to grow more aware
- to promote community connection

<!--
But let's start simple! (read slide). I propose that our existing internal group "Tech Connect" can come up with a survey and method to select relevant projects, and then we divide up the money, and use Github Sponsors to give the money. Please note this is not a tax write-off -- the small teams and developers I am proposing we support are not 501c3 organizations. If that makes this impossible, we can of course get creative. Thank you!
