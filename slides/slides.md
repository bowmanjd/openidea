## Engaging the Free Software behind our Productivity

<!--
I am Jonathan Bowman. Inviting you to consider how we can be aware and involved in the free software that sustains our work here at Cargas.

## Proposal

A "coin jar" of $1000 annually to distribute to free software projects with or upon which our products are built

<!-- 
The idea, in a nutshell: that we have $1000 to play a game of generosity and gratitude once a year. Give back to the maintainers of the open source software we rely on.

A story about my own values, Cargas's values, and some intersection points.

It was 1999, and I was finishing college. I had managed to surround myself with a lot of good will and idealism: many of my friends were pursuing sustainable engineering, sustainable agriculture. That is, technologies that met the needs of people over the long term, even generations, rather than merely take advantage of them in the moment.

And I found this compelling. But I was not a civil engineer or a farmer. I was a general nerd, though. I then someone turned me on to Linux. This is Tux, the Linux penguin. Linux was sustainable software. Software that was open and transparent, available for free yet providing revenue-generating opportunities. It was software that was high quality, flexible, and enduring.

Today, each of you use Linux throughout a sizeable portion of your day. Linux, and other Unix-like free operating systems such as Darwin and BSD have been around for decades, yet power the iPhone or Android device you just got yesterday, and most of the web you use on a regular basis.

<!-- Fast forward to today. My values are similar to the college student attracted to Linux. And while I still use Linux every day and all day, values of collaboration, being open, finding enduring methods for success (aka "built to last") -- these values are primarily fleshed out here at work at Cargas. A place of work I remain attracted to for the same reasons I was attracted to open source software to begin with.

In other words, there is some ideological convergence here. And the potential for more.

<!--
I'd like to introduce or remind us of what and who open source software is. Some of the biggest software cornerstones are free and open source. I suspect there is at least one of these you recognize. VS Code, React, Apache Spark and almost anything to do with data science. These are free as in free of cost. But also free as in open and free as in collaboratively developed. You may also notice the size and wealth of the companies behind these. Microsoft, Meta, Google. Some big non-profits, too, which are backed by Microsoft, Google, IBM...

<!-- 

But not all open source projects have the backing of giants. A lot of them have normal individuals behind them. And average-sized companies, too. Here is a random selection of smaller, perhaps unheard of, open source projects that people at Cargas rely on. Some have good financial backing, some do not.

## Dreaming...

- Favor open source tools and building blocks
- Learn processes and culture from established open source projects
- Consider the [Open Source Pledge](https://opensourcepledge.com/)
- Donate to [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com)
- Use developer time to contribute code back to open source tools
  - maybe a Hackathon!
- release some open source projects in a public repository

## A Modest Exercise

A "coin jar" of $1000 annually to distribute to free software projects with or upon which our products are built

- to give back
- to grow more aware
- to promote connection
