## Dreaming...

- Favor open source tools and building blocks
- Learn processes and culture from established open source projects
- Consider the [Open Source Pledge](https://opensourcepledge.com/)
- Donate to [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com)
- Use developer time to contribute code back to open source tools
  - maybe a Hackathon!
- release some open source projects in a public Cargas repository

## A Modest Exercise

A "coin jar" of $1000 annually to distribute to free software projects with or upon which our products are built

- to give back
- to grow more aware
