Okay, here's a draft outline for your 5-minute presentation, geared towards convincing your software company to contribute to open source, specifically through a small, targeted fund.  I've included suggested visuals to help keep it engaging.  I've also broken down timing estimates for each section.  This assumes a fairly fast pace – you'll need to practice to fit it all in!

**Presentation Title:  Investing in Our Foundation: Supporting the Open Source We Rely On**



**I. Introduction (30 seconds)**

*   **Goal:**  Grab attention, state the purpose, and establish a positive tone.
*   **Talking Points:**
    *   "Good morning/afternoon everyone.  We build amazing software here, and we're proud of it. But our work doesn't happen in a vacuum."
    *   "Today, I want to talk about the critical role open source software plays in *our* success, and how a small investment can ensure its continued health."
    *   "I'm proposing we establish a small fund to directly support the developers who create and maintain the tools we depend on."
*   **Visual:**
    *   **Slide 1: Title Slide** -  "Investing in Our Foundation: Supporting the Open Source We Rely On" -  Include your company logo.  A background image subtly hinting at interconnectedness (e.g., a network diagram, a circuit board) is good.

**II. The Open Source Reality (1 minute 30 seconds)**

*   **Goal:**  Demonstrate *how much* your company relies on open source.  Make it concrete and relatable.  Avoid abstract arguments.
*   **Talking Points:**
    *   "Let's be honest: open source is *everywhere* in our stack."
    *   **Specifically list 3-5 key open source projects your company uses.**  (e.g., "We use React for our front-end, Node.js for our backend, PostgreSQL for our database, and libraries like Lodash for utility functions.")  *This is crucial.  Don't generalize; be specific.*
    *   "These aren't just 'free tools.' They're actively developed and maintained by individuals and small teams, often working in their spare time."
    *   "Think about what would happen if these projects were abandoned.  Security vulnerabilities wouldn't be patched.  Bugs wouldn't be fixed.  Our development would grind to a halt."
    *   "We benefit *directly* from their work, every single day."
*   **Visual:**
    *   **Slide 2: "Our Open Source Dependencies"** - A visually appealing list of the 3-5 key projects you mentioned.  Include logos.  Maybe a simple graphic showing arrows pointing *to* your company logo *from* the open source project logos.
    *   **Slide 3:  "The Cost of Doing Nothing"** -  A simple graphic illustrating potential consequences:  "Security Risks," "Development Slowdown," "Increased Maintenance Burden."  Keep it concise.

**III. The Problem: Sustainability (1 minute)**

*   **Goal:** Explain why open source developers need support.  Focus on the challenges they face.
*   **Talking Points:**
    *   "Many open source developers are unpaid or underpaid for the immense value they provide."
    *   "They often rely on donations, sponsorships, or side jobs to keep projects going."
    *   "Burnout is a real issue.  Maintaining a popular open source project is a *lot* of work – bug fixes, feature requests, security audits, documentation…"
    *   "Without sustainable funding, talented developers may move on to other projects, leaving critical tools vulnerable."
    *   "We're essentially relying on the goodwill of others.  Let's be proactive and contribute to their sustainability."
*   **Visual:**
    *   **Slide 4: "The Developer's Dilemma"** -  A simple graphic depicting a developer juggling multiple tasks (work, family, open source project).  Or a chart showing the disparity between the value provided by open source and the funding received.  (e.g., a bar graph with "Value to Industry" very high and "Average Developer Income" relatively low).  A quote from an open source maintainer about the challenges they face could be powerful.

**IV. The Solution: Our Open Source Support Fund (1 minute)**

*   **Goal:**  Present your proposal clearly and address potential concerns.
*   **Talking Points:**
    *   "I propose we establish an 'Open Source Support Fund' with an initial annual budget of $500."
    *   "This isn't about large-scale philanthropy. It's a targeted investment in the tools we *already* use."
    *   "We'll identify developers of key projects and offer small donations as a token of our appreciation and support." (e.g., via GitHub Sponsors, Open Collective, or direct donation).
    *   "A small team (perhaps from engineering) will be responsible for identifying projects and managing the fund."
    *   "This demonstrates our commitment to the open source community and strengthens our relationships with key developers."
    *   "It's a relatively low-risk, high-reward initiative."
*   **Visual:**
    *   **Slide 5: "Our Proposal: The Open Source Support Fund"** -  Bullet points:
        *   $500 Annual Budget
        *   Targeted Support for Key Projects
        *   Managed by [Engineering Team/Small Group]
        *   Donation Methods: GitHub Sponsors, Open Collective, etc.
    *   **Slide 6: "Benefits"** - Bullet points:
        *   Improved Security & Reliability
        *   Stronger Developer Relationships
        *   Positive Brand Image
        *   Sustainable Ecosystem

**V. Conclusion & Call to Action (30 seconds)**

*   **Goal:**  Reinforce the benefits and ask for approval.
*   **Talking Points:**
    *   "Investing in open source isn't just the right thing to do; it's the smart thing to do."
    *   "By supporting the developers who build the tools we rely on, we're investing in our own future."
    *   "I'm confident that this small fund will make a meaningful difference."
    *   "I'm asking for your approval to launch the Open Source Support Fund."
*   **Visual:**
    *   **Slide 7: "Let's Invest in Our Foundation"** -  A compelling image representing collaboration and growth.  Your company logo prominently displayed.  A simple "Thank You" and your contact information.



**Important Notes & Tips:**

*   **Practice, Practice, Practice:**  5 minutes goes by *fast*.  Rehearse your presentation multiple times to ensure you stay within the time limit.
*   **Know Your Audience:**  Tailor your language and examples to your company's culture and technical expertise.
*   **Be Prepared for Questions:**  Anticipate potential questions (e.g., "How will we choose projects?", "What's the ROI?") and have answers ready.
*   **Focus on the "What's In It For Us"**: While altruism is good, emphasize the practical benefits to your company.
*   **Keep it Simple:**  Avoid technical jargon and complex arguments.
*   **Enthusiasm is Key:**  Show your passion for open source!




Good luck with your presentation!  Let me know if you'd like me to refine any part of this outline or visuals.
